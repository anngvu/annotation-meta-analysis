attribute_id,project,rationale
nf-osi:Author,NF-OSI,"Contains direct identifiers or identity-linked identifiers (personal name, ORCID ID, GitHub profile link). These values can reveal or directly link to an individual, so classification is High risk."
el:BackgroundTrait,EL,"Describes health/behavioral background traits of study participants (e.g., nicotine dependence). This is highly sensitive clinical/behavioral information and can reveal sensitive phenotypes, so should be treated as High risk."
gf:Comment,GF,"Unstructured free-text QC comment with no validation or constraints; may contain direct identifiers, PII/PHI, or other sensitive information and thus poses high re-identification/privacy risk."
nf-osi:CompoundDose,NF-OSI,Contains clinical treatment information (dose quantity for a treatment compound). Treatment/clinical data are highly sensitive as they reveal health status and regimen and could contribute to re-identification when linked with other data; no validation/masking specified.
nf-osi:Diagnosis,NF-OSI,"This attribute records an individual’s clinical diagnosis (specific health condition), which is highly sensitive personal health information. Diagnosis data can reveal medical conditions and thus poses a high re-identification/privacy risk."
mc2:FileTumorType,MC2,"Contains clinical diagnosis information (tumor type), which is sensitive health data. Disclosure of tumor type reveals an individual’s medical condition and can be highly identifying when combined with other data, so it should be classified as High risk."
adkp:IndividualID,ADKP,Explicit identifying string directly linked to the individual or animal being studied — a direct identifier that enables re-identification; classified as high risk.
el:IndividualID,EL,Direct identifying string linked to the individual or animal provided by the contributor — a direct identifier that reveals personal identity and enables re-identification.
htan:MSIStatus,HTAN,"MSIStatus is a clinical/genomic biomarker (microsatellite stability vs instability) indicating tumor biology and disease-related information. As sensitive health/genomic data that can affect clinical interpretation and privacy, it should be treated as high sensitivity."
nf-osi:Nf1Genotype,NF-OSI,Contains individual genetic information (NF1 genotype) that can reveal a heritable disorder (neurofibromatosis type 1) and is potentially identifying and highly sensitive health data; no masking/constraints specified increases re-identification and privacy risk.
nf-osi:Nf2Genotype,NF-OSI,"This is individual-level genetic information (NF2 gene genotype) derived from a biospecimen. Genomic data can reveal disease risk and is potentially identifiable and highly sensitive, so it meets the High sensitivity category."
gf:ParticipantID,GF,Direct identifier: an ID associated with a patient is a personal identifier that can directly identify or link to individuals; no masking or validation rules provided to reduce re-identification risk.
el:ReagentContact,EL,"Contains contact information for reagent source; this is a direct identifier that can reveal personal identity or enable contact/re-identification, so it is high sensitivity."
